To set a memory limit for a group called "500M" using `/etc/security/limits.conf`, you will need to use the `cgroup` feature since `limits.conf` itself does not directly support memory limits. However, you can set resource limits such as max logins, core file size, etc. directly in `limits.conf`.

For setting memory limits, you would typically use cgroups directly or use systemd slices as described earlier. Nevertheless, you can use PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) with `pam_cgroup` or other related modules. 

Here's how you can limit the memory for a group using `limits.conf` indirectly with `cgroup`.

### Setting up cgroup for memory limit

1. **Create a cgroup for the group**:
   
   First, create a cgroup and set memory limits for it.

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/500M
   sudo bash -c 'echo 1G > /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/500M/memory.limit_in_bytes'
   ```

2. **Assign users of the group to this cgroup**:
   
   You can use PAM to automatically place users in the correct cgroup. Install `libpam-cgroup`:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install libpam-cgroup
   ```

3. **Configure PAM**:
   
   Edit the `/etc/security/cgrules.conf` file to set rules for the group.

   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/cgrules.conf
   ```

   Add a rule to assign the `500M` group to the `500M` cgroup for memory:

   ```plaintext
   @500M memory /500M
   ```

4. **Configure `cgrulesengd`**:
   
   Edit `/etc/cgconfig.conf` to make sure the cgroup is created with the correct limits on system boot.

   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/cgconfig.conf
   ```

   Add the following content:

   ```plaintext
   group 500M {
       memory {
           memory.limit_in_bytes = 1G;
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Configure PAM to use `pam_cgroup`**:
   
   Edit the PAM configuration to load the `pam_cgroup` module.

   Edit `/etc/pam.d/common-session` and `/etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive`:

   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-session
   ```

   Add the following line:

   ```plaintext
   session optional pam_cgroup.so
   ```

### Apply and Verify

6. **Restart Services**:

   Restart the necessary services to apply the changes:

   ```sh
   sudo systemctl restart cgred
   sudo systemctl restart cgconfig
   ```

7. **Reboot the System**:

   Reboot the system to ensure all configurations are applied correctly.

   ```sh
   sudo reboot
   ```

8. **Verify**:

   After rebooting, log in as a user belonging to the `500M` group and verify that the user is placed into the correct cgroup and the memory limits are enforced.

   ```sh
   cgget -g memory:500M
   ```

   This should show the memory limit you have set.

### Summary

While `/etc/security/limits.conf` itself doesn't directly support memory limits, you can achieve this using cgroups and PAM configuration to enforce memory limits for a group. This setup requires a combination of configuring cgroups, using `pam_cgroup`, and ensuring proper integration through PAM configuration files.
